# HR Employee Attrition Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **Excel** to identify key workforce trends and attrition drivers. The analysis focuses on understanding how factors such as department, job role, tenure, and job satisfaction influence employee attrition.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub

## Dataset
The project uses the **IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset**, which includes employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, tenure, and attrition status.

## Objectives
- Calculate overall employee attrition rate  
- Identify departments and job roles with high attrition  
- Compare tenure between employees who left and those who stayed  
- Analyze the relationship between job satisfaction and attrition  
- Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard  

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to:
- Compute overall attrition percentage
- Analyze department-wise and role-wise attrition
- Compare average tenure for attrition vs retention
- Evaluate job satisfaction impact on attrition

All queries are available in the `sql/` folder.

## Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize:
- Overall attrition KPIs
- Attrition by department and job role
- Job satisfaction vs attrition
- Employee distribution across departments

Dashboard image is available in the `dashboard/` folder.

## Key Insights
- Overall attrition rate is approximately **16%**
- Research & Development department shows the highest attrition
- Certain job roles such as Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive have higher attrition
- Employees with lower job satisfaction are more likely to leave
- Employees who left generally had lower average tenure

## Outcome
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data analysis, Excel for validation, and Tableau for data visualization and storytelling. It reflects an end-to-end analytics workflow from raw data to actionable insights.
